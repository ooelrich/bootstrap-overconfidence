\section{Introduction}

We use the following data-generating process

\begin{equation*}
    y = x_1 \beta_1 + x_2 \beta_2 \sqrt{\frac{df-2}{df}}\varepsilon, \qquad \varepsilon \sim t_{df}
\end{equation*}

The reason that the error term looks the way it does is that we want to be able to specify data-generating processes with differently shaped error term distributions (varying thiccnes) while keeping the error term variance fixed.

We compare two models on the form

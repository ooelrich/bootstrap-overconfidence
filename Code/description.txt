Description

Each experiment is run using a specific design
matrix, which includes a response variable WITHOUT
any noise added to it (the true response). This
response matrix is stored in *design_mat*. The
number of observations in each data set is stored in
*n_ob*. *n_parents* determine how many different data
sets are used to do the bootstrapping. The number of
boostrap samples drawn for each parent is given by
*n_bss*. Everything is run once for each values of
degrees of freedom in the *dfs* vector. Note that
the code is parallized in such a way that it runs one
version for each value in *dfs* at the same time, so
don't specify more different degrees of freedom than
you have cores (times two). *sim_reps* determines the
number of replicates used to obtain the true sampling
variance. If you want to specify the variance of the
misspecified model, do this using *sigma2*. If you do
not want to specify the error variance, set *sigma2*
to be zero.
